# Nine-Queens
The Game of Nine Queens
### Instead of playing The game of eight queens, there is a game called The game of nine queens
**How To Play**
In this game there will be a 9*9 chess board, we can place queens on the chess board so that they cannot attack each other, that is, any two queens cannot be in the same row, column, and row of the chessboard. on the diagonal.
If one side is within the attack range of other queens when placing the queen, that side loses and the game is over!
If you can't make any placements, it's game over!
